map(int): it is used for storing the strings into integer format by using list() we kept in array and by using set()
we store it in the set .

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"]):
used for get and post method for form handel as i used for web interface .

{{}},{% %} : these are the basic flask env which are used for  the output and condition to check in html file .

logic behind this :

       for element in array:
            if element in A:
                happiness += 1
            elif element in B:
                happiness -= 1

Thank you .Happy Coding.
